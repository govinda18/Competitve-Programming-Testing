# Competitve-Programming-Testing

This is a small bash-gcc environment set up for competitive programming. The set up helps to easily test your codes against brute force solution by generating random test cases using [Codeforces' testlib](https://codeforces.com/testlib).

## Usage

 - Complete the function writeTest in in [generator.cpp](https://github.com/govinda18/Competitve-Programming-Testing/blob/master/generator.cpp).
- Write your intended solution in [solution.cpp](https://github.com/govinda18/Competitve-Programming-Testing/blob/master/solution.cpp)
- Write your brute force or sub-optimal correct soution in [brute.cpp](https://github.com/govinda18/Competitve-Programming-Testing/blob/master/brute.cpp)
- Finally, run `test.sh <number of tests>`.
